    <h3>Does it live up to the hype?</h3>
    <h4>By Maximo Diaz</h4>
    <h2>Review on Boaterola's Fold S1 and SPro Max</h2>

    <p>Boaterola’s latest flagship phone, the Interstellar Fold S1, and SPro Max have created much buzz on social media over these past couple of days. The Boaterola Tech Conference held in San Jose, California, shows their upcoming products for the winter season of 2021. The Conference showed revision of their successful brand of laptops with better CPU and GPU upgrades from the latest year and improvement on their Tablet Department. However, the thing that captivated the audience was the introduction of a new product line. John Stamos, CEO of the Boaterola, introduces the Interstellar Fold S1 and SPro Max to the world. Finally, Boaterola has entered the world of the foldable Phone market. Stamos proudly promises that the Interstellar Fold S1 and SPro would demolish their competitors (Pear and Sammysung) both in price and raw power.</p>

    <p>According to the presentation during the Conference, they constantly promoted the slogan of “It’s out of this World.” The audience was shocked to hear when they stated that starting price for the devices. <i><b>The Interstellar Fold S1 starts at 500 USD, and their premium offering, the SPro Max, is staring at 800 USD</b></i>. They explained to the audience why these phones were so inexpensive compared to their rivals. Boaterola stated that they learned from the mistakes of their competitors and threw a slight jab at Sammysung’s botched release of their foldable phone the year prior by saying that “We actually spend time researching a glass that does bend the laws of physics and doesn’t breakdown within a month of normal use.” In addition, they promoted their <i><b>new in-house-made ARM Processor Chips called “Excel 21” stating that they were ten times as fast as their previous flagship phone</b></i>. This new line of phones has seen a <i><b>bump in RAM from 6 GB in the last flagship to 12GB on their base model</b></i>. Unlike most competitors, the S1 and SPro Max will have <i><b>expandable Storage Up to 1 TB</b></i>if you are fond of storing pictures and music. The Weakest segment from the presentation was in the camera department;</b><i>Boaterola will continue to use last year’s flagship Camera as a cost-cutting measure</i></b> still made by the camera company Laika. Overall, it is an excellent presentation for the recent upstart technological giant; its recent demonstration has shown that they are a force to be reckoned with. Now, it’s Pear and Sammysung to play catch up with this high group of engineers and programmers at Boaterola. Next up, I will give my first impression of their products after a week of usage from an early review copy sent to me by Boaterola themselves.</p>
