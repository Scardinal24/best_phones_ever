<h2>How SammySung Came To Be</h2>
<p>It all started with a 12 year old boy. Suprisingly, his name wan't Sam. His name was actually Tim. He was by himself most of the time due to his parents traveling for work. He didn't have many friends, so he was bored all of the time. Eventually, he started building his own computer. In 2011, Tim finished making a computer that could bluetooth to the television.</p>

<p>He was only 17 when he finished his first big project. He then wanted to make a phone designed to bluetooth to one's vehicle. In May of 2021, he launched the first phone to be able to bluetooth to a car. He created the name of his newly established company after his brother that passed away when he was little.</p>
