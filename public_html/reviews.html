<p>"I got the new model a while back and have been waiting to write a review until I've had it for a bit. I haven't stopped loving it any less since the day I bought it! I love how it feels with it's natural pear shape. I really like the blue color as well."</p>

<p>"The camera on this phone is absolutely amazing! I get to capture all of my kids growing up in 4k. I can only imagine if my parents had this while I was a kid, I would be able to look at all the memories in crystal clear resolution."

<p>"This phone is fast, reliable, and best of all super cool! It fits perfectly in my palm. Ever since I switched to the Pear Phone I haven't gotten any hand cramps. With the pear shape design it makes it very easy to type with one hand. I dont have to feel self concious about my tiny fingers."</p>
<p>- James Murray</p>

<p>"This phone is spectacular. It has great speakers that are perfect for when I'm listening to music out loud and hanging out with my friends. I'd give it a perfect 10/10."
